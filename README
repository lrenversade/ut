UT Library
==========

This is a collection of general-purpose C utilities.

The library includes functions for: memory allocation and free'ing,
operations on arrays, operations on vectors and matrices,
geometrical transformations, etc.

The library tends to be documented using doxygen, hence the `config'
file in the root directory. The documentation is quite sparse, though.
